			<p>This was my first project as lead developer, so I got pretty excited for it. I started to implement a bunch of things I had been learning on the side. First off, I added Composer, NPM, and Bower as package managers and build dependency checkers. Composer handles the Wordpress core, plus plugins and themes if we need it. NPM handles all the development dependencies like Gulp, Sass, Autoprefixer, JSLint, and BrowserSync. And Bower handled the site dependencies including jQuery, FontAwesome, and Bootstrap. I also implemented a change in our git process to move from a Waterfall workflow to a Gitflow relying on branches.</p>

			<p>This was an in-house project for the Search Engine Marketing side of the company. They were getting tired of pulling all of the data by hand and writing up summaries for our clients. And I didn't blame them. We hooked into all the APIs we could, grabbing social media traffic, domain authority scores, and keyword rankings for the client and their major competitors. Then we tied it all together in one easy to digest dashboard for our clients to follow along with. It was also pretty easy on the eyes, too.</p>

			<p>This was another pre-built site that needed added functionality. The client needed a way to track lost sales and abandoned carts but their unique clientelle made using available plugins impossible. Teachers would often save things in their cart, but the school administrator's would make the final purchase. I created a Magento plugin that would track these abandoned carts and send reminders to the appropriate places. While researching Magento's core functionality, I also implemented some extra Google Analytics to track purchases throughout the site.</p>

			<p>This site had already been built by the time I joined the project, but the client wanted a new feature. As a publishing company with multiple print brands and thousands of readers, Engle Publishing wanted a way to streamline their transactions with advertisers. We created an online portal and management system for them that also doubles as a reviews forum and even more advertising. We built the portal on top of their already familiar Wordpress backend and allowed all of their vendors to control their own business listing's info. The new portal was connected to Engle's own database of clients and advertisements so the site was updated regularly via a scheduled import process.</p>

Most of the functionality had already been built, but I got a chance to review it with the other developers and start to learn their conventions and coding style. I learned all about Sass and began polishing the site's front-end design. I was able to add in all the remaining styles and some finishing touches of JavaScript before handing it off to the clients for training. I also started learning the benefits of Git now that I was in a collaborative environment.</p>

        		<p>As the Marketing Director, one of my main responsibilities was maintaining the website. When it was handed over to me, it was a pile of Dreamweaver bloat composed of nested tables, missing tags, and deprecated practices. A devs nightmare. I did what I could to temporarily fix the 230 some static pages, update all the necessary info, and increase its usability. But a more effective solution was still needed. So I built a new site using the Squarespace CMS and a custom theme. This allows a little more flexibility in keeping the massive amount of information current and correct with the help of a few extra staff members capable of copy writing but not coding. This also alowed for a future-proofed maintenance plan since I was planning on leaving the organization.</p>

So I implemented some new things: HTLM5 elements, a responsive design, contact form validation that actually does its job, clean URLs, and a site structure that makes a little more sense and allows for expansion. The visual style is less about bells and whistles and more about letting my personality shine through. There are still plenty of things that will need fixing, but after all was said and done, I sat back and looked at a site that I was truly proud to call my own.</p>

        		<p>This was my first official rebrand and like most others, I imagine, it was a complex balancing act. As the Marketing Director, I was given full control of the process. I could've easily just designed a logo according to my tastes and called it a day. But to do so would be to toss out the 50+ years of the organization's history, the vision for its future, and the opinions of the board, the staff, and the stakeholders. It would also fly in the face of the true purpose of design: not just to make something pretty, but to solve a problem. The problem here was to bring the organization into a new season of life and to continue being relevant to consumers while not alienating the established customers with something new and foreign.</p>

				<p>A fun little project for a digital media class. The prompt was to create an interactive multi-media story. Most of my classmates took the path of a choose-your-own adventure book. Some went with a more artsy direction and simply created more alternative content to meld with their story. But both of these directions kept the story within the set boundaries of their creator's. I decided to open source my story.The plan was to write the opening lines to a story: describe setting, introduce a strong main character, and then create some form of conflict. The seeds of a story. Then I would use my knowledge of web programming to create a form where contributors could add the next paragraphs of the story. As it grew, I would add illustrations and sound bites to add some flair, as well as help contribute to the story itself. This has been one of my favorite ideas for a web project so far.</p>

This was the culmination of all the things I had learned so far and I wanted to show it off. With this philosophy in mind, it became a little exaggerated. I added in all the bells and whistles I knew, mostly in the form of complex JavaScript animation. I eschewed usability for artistic license. I was young and naive.

				<p>I convinced my Professor to allow an alternate submission for the course's final project. Instead of research paper, I built a website. The prompt was to do an Ethnographic Study, a study of cultural phenomenon in the vein of the philosophers we had read so far (i.e. Sarte, Descartes, Heidegger, etc.). So I created a fake survey. On the surface, it seemed to be nothing more than a simple poll. But underneath, it was secretly tracking completion rates. A JavaScript function randomized the three different surveys to remove as many variables as possible. Each survey had a fake loading screen responding to a setTimeout function. The hypothesis: the longer people had to wait in line, so to speak, the more likely they were to give up on the survey part way through. However, the PHP tracking the initial results supported the opposite theory: that Americans truly do enjoy waiting in line.</p>

				<p>This is where it all began. During my year off of school in between Drexel and Temple, I needed something to keep my mind active. I decided to build myself a Wordpress blog to learn how to code. It was a big undertaking, and I had no idea how far the rabbit hole went, but I dove in. I would wake up hours before my shift at the coffee shop and pour over the Wordpress codex. I mixed and mashed a Frankenstein monster out of my favorite bits from tutorial sites. I went through introductory lessons of HTML and CSS. I learned about domains and hosting, about coding by hand versus WYSIWYG editors, about valid code and semantics. I also learned a million ways to break a website. But I finished it. I proudly started blogging about all the tips and tricks about the outdoors that I knew. Then I ran out of article ideas. So I came up with more websites to build. That was the fun part anyways.</p>

        		<p>This was my first official rebrand and like most others, I imagine, it was a complex balancing act. As the Marketing Director, I was given full control of the process. I could've easily just designed a logo according to my tastes and called it a day. But to do so would be to toss out the 50+ years of the organization's history, the vision for its future, and the opinions of the board, the staff, and the stakeholders. It would also fly in the face of the true purpose of design: not just to make something pretty, but to solve a problem. The problem here was to bring the organization into a new season of life and to continue being relevant to consumers while not alienating the established customers with something new and foreign.</p>

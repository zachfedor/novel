		<h2>Clue #2</h2>
		<p>A small pool of blood surrounds the victim. Too small. Your first thought is that the murder, if there is one, took place somewhere else, and this is where they dumped him. This isn't your last thought, though. After the autopsy, the lab technician reveals that the rest of the blood is where it should be: inside the victim. After such a traumatic head wound, the only possible explanation for the small loss of blood is that the wound was post-mortem. What other clues will point to Cause of Death?</p>

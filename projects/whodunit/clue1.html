		<h2>Clue #1</h2>
		<p>The victim's skull is obviously crushed from blunt force trauma to the front of the head. However, this trauma is not consistent with any man-made hand weapon. Furthermore, if one were to assume that the victim was standing at the time of the alleged attack, a blow to the front of the head would likely result in his body falling backwards, landing faceup. Instead, the victim is lying facedown. These wounds look more similar to a jumper. What other clues can you find?</p>

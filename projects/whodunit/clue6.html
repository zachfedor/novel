		<h2>Clue #6</h2>
		<p>Inside another pocket, you find a hand-written note addressed to the victim. It is signed by "Marla." The language in the letter leads you to assume that this is the wife. The letter doesn't bear good tidings though.</p>
		<p>Apparently the wife is informing the victim that she has ran off with another guy. The letter doesn't mention a name, but the victim seems to be familiar with this character. It also mentions a destination: Chester, a suburb south-west of Philadelphia. It also mentions that she spent the families meager savings to buy 4 one-way tickets to Philly International Airport. This could imply that she took the boys with her.</p>
		<p>Regardless of his intent (either to reconcile with his wife or not), it is till unclear how the victim managed to make it all the way from Boston without any savings, and how/why he ended up in North Philadelphia...</p>

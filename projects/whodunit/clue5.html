		<h2>Clue #5</h2>
		<p>Underneath the body, you find a tree branch. It appears to have come from the tree nearest the body. Did it come down in the storm a few days back, and he just happened to land on it by chance?</p>
		<p>Closer inspection reveals blood on the branch. Could it be the murder weapon? Doubtful, though, that a stick could do that kind of work on a person without breaking.</p>
		<p>Autopsy results show further damage: a few broken ribs, fractured left ulna and radius, fractured left femur, and extensive internal hemorrhaging. And just like the info gleaned in Clue #2, all these wounds were received post-mortem. With all this interconnection of evidence, perhaps you should take a time out to recap what you have so far.</p>

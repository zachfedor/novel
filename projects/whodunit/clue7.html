		<h2>Clue #7</h2>
		<p>The only other item on the victim's person is a smashed cell phone. It was in the victim's front pocket, probably breaking from whatever caused the victim's full-frontal trauma. It doesn't work anymore, but the SIM card is intact. You take it out of the phone and place it into yours.</p>
		<p>You discover a handful of contacts, but nothing out of the ordinary. Then you check the recent calls. Starting around 7:00 pm last night, there is a large amount of outgoing calls to "Marla." None of them were answered. The last is at 2:42 am. Then there is one more call this morning at 6:55 am to "Prez." This lasted a little over 10 minutes and puts the victim's time of death between 7:05 am and 9:45 am.</p>
		<p>On a hunch, you call this "Prez" from your phone. It turns out to be Ray Prezluski, a former employee at Logan International with Fred, now working on PHL's groundcrew and Fred's only friend in the Philadelphia area. Ray readily admits he recieved a call from the victim this morning. He says Fred sounded distraught, and that he mentioned something about coming to Philly to get his wife. Fred also asked to borrow Prez's car. However, Prez said Fred never showed up at their meeting place at the airport terminal. Prez willingly came in to be questioned further. He said he tried to call Fred numerous times, but the phone was off. He assumed Fred had settled down and didn't make the trip after all, or maybe he couldn't afford the airfare.</p>
		<p>Prez grieved at the news of his friend's death, and also expressed concern and confusion towards Fred ending up in North Philadelphia.</p>

		<p>Did you figure it out? Go to the bottom of the page and type in your theory. After you hit "Submit," you will be given the answer, so make sure your theory doesn't have any holes.</p>
		<p>And remember: this is a lateral thinking puzzle. You have all the pieces of evidence you need to solve this riddle. You just need to sift through all the data, find out what is important and what is extraneous detail, and piece it together. If you're just posting a fake answer to get the real one, I ask you not to give up hope. Team up with a friend and put your heads together. I know you can do it.</p>

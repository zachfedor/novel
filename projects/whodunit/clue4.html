		<h2>Clue #4</h2>
		<p>You find a worn old wallet in the victim's back pocket. No Cash. Was he mugged?</p>
		<p>There is also section of photos in the wallet. The first appears to be torn out, but the other three all show the same two young boys, probably sons but you can't tell a resemblance with his face in the state it is. No picture of wife. Jilted lover?</p>
		<p>You also find identification. The victim is one Fred Connolly. Born December 6th, 1968. No driver's license, this info is found on an ID Badge for Logan International Airport. Probably a worker on the tarmac given oil and grease stains on the pants.</p>

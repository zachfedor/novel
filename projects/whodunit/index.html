		<h2>A Game</h2>
		<p>I have created this little game for a class of mine, but you are invited to enjoy it. A body has been discovered on campus. If you enjoy solving riddles, you should get over there and figure this one out. Explore it as best you can, and use the QR Codes to examine the evidence. Put all the pieces together to solve this case. Good luck!</p>
		<ul>
			<li><h4>But before you grab your magnifying glass, read these ground rules!</h4></li>
			<li>- Don't mess with the crime scene. Touching or moving anything could potentially destroy evidence!</li>
			<li>- This is only a game. All the events described are entirely fictional.</li>
			<li>- The only way to examine evidence is with a QR Code reader. Scan the codes at the crime scene and you will be linked to a page on this site that describes the clue in greater detail. If you don't have one on your phone, find a friend who does and work together.</li>
			<li>- If you discover the truth, congratulations! But don't ruin it for someone else and keep it to yourself.</li>
			<li>- At the bottom of every Clue page, there will be a link to enter your solution. You will then recieve the answer to check if you were right.</li>
			<li>- Don't give up. This is a hard puzzle, and requires a lot of lateral thinking. Try to think outside the box. And try not to submit a fake answer just to get the real one.</li>
			<li>- This little game will only be up for a limited time, so I'd suggest getting over there quick.</li>

		<p>Well... what are you waiting for?!</p>

		<p>I hate to tell you this, but this project is a little old. The portion that lived in the physical world is no longer there. But if you still want to check it out, you can find all the clues and much more at the link below!</p>

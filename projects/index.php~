				<p class="projectDescription">A fun little project for a digital media class. The prompt was to create an interactive multi-media story. Most of my classmates took the path of a choose-your-own adventure book. Some went with a more artsy direction and simply created more alternative content to meld with their story. But both of these directions kept the story within the set boundaries of their creator's. I decided to open source my story.The plan was to write the opening lines to a story: describe setting, introduce a strong main character, and then create some form of conflict. The seeds of a story. Then I would use my knowledge of web programming to create a form where contributors could add the next paragraphs of the story. As it grew, I would add illustrations and sound bites to add some flair, as well as help contribute to the story itself. This has been one of my favorite ideas for a web project so far.</p>

				<p class="projectDescription">A QR Code interactive mystery game that lived half in the real world and half in the virtual. I created a fake crime scene in the middle of Temple University's campus complete with a chalk outline and hidden evidence. Amateur detectives had to scan the QR code attached to the evidence to get more info. With all the clues, they could make a guess as to what really happened. Then they were redirected to the full story.</p>

				<p class="projectDescription">After my time at SportFitDeal, I stayed on with the Lead Developer to work on some other projects. Both Lexington Technologies and Music Molds were made during this time. For Lexington Technologies, I took a primary role as Copy Writer and Designer. I worked through the Wordpress back-end to create most of the pages and navigation. I also did all of the page styling according to the client's wishes. I worked on this project from concept to launch.</p>

				<p class="projectDescription">After my time at SportFitDeal, I stayed on with the Lead Developer to work on some other projects. Both Lexington Technologies and Music Molds were made during this time. I took a mostly secondary role for this project while the Lead Developer walked me through the entire process from concept to launch. I also worked directly with the client to create content for many of the pages. I processed all of the photos and wrote the product descriptions.</p>

<!-- sportfitdeal -->
				<h2 class="projectTitle">sportfitdeal</h2>

				<h3 class="projectDate projectMeta"><strong>date: </strong>fall 2011 - winter 2012</h3>
				<h3 class="projectTech projectMeta"><strong>tech used: </strong>wordpress - php</h3>
				<h3 class="projectStatus projectMeta"><strong>status: </strong>unmaintained</h3>

				<p class="projectDescription">SportFitDeal was a web startup in the Philadelphia area that offered deals for local businesses in the health and fitness industry. After primary construction was completed by lead developer but before launch, I was hired as the Product &amp; Support Expert. My main duties were to head up site maintenance and customer support. I ensured compatibility of upgrades, both of Wordpress and plug-ins. I pushed out all major updates and daily updates of the website. I also assisted customers directly with account questions and technical problems. After the Marketing Intern resigned, I took on her duties working directly under the owner. I designed all of the advertising pieces and started a business to business affiliate program.</p>

				<h3 class="projectStatus projectMeta"><strong>status: </strong>archived</h3>

				<p class="projectDescription">I was looking for some freelance work to get my feet wet, but I needed a portfolio first. So I made one. This was the culmination of all the things I had learned so far and I wanted to show it off. With this philosophy in mind, it became a little exaggerated. I added in all the bells and whistles I knew, mostly in the form of complex JavaScript animation. I eschewed usability for artistic license. I was young and naive.</p>

<!-- ethnographic studies -->
				<h2 class="projectTitle">ethnographic studies</h2>

				<img class="projectImage grayscale" src="http://www.zachfedor.com/images/philweb.png" alt="ethnographic studies" height="204" width="304">

				<h3 class="projectTech projectMeta"><strong>tech used: </strong>php - javascript</h3>
				<h3 class="projectStatus projectMeta"><strong>status: </strong>archived</h3>

				<p class="projectDescription">I convinced my Professor to allow an alternate submission to our Philosophy of the Human final project. Instead of research paper, I built a website. The prompt was to do an Ethnographic Study, a study of cultural phenomenon, in the vein of the philosophers we had read so far (i.e. Sarte, Descartes, Heidegger, etc.). So I created a fake survey. On the surface, it seemed to be nothing more than a simple poll. But underneath, it was secretly tracking completion rates. A JavaScript function randomized the three different surveys to remove as many variables as possible. Each survey had a fake loading screen responding to a setTimeout function. The hypothesis: the longer people had to wait in line, so to speak, the more likely they were to give up on the survey part way through. However, the PHP tracking the initial results supported the opposite theory: that Americans truly do enjoy waiting in line.</p>

				<h3 class="projectTech projectMeta"><strong>tech used: </strong>php - mysql - javascript</h3>
				<h3 class="projectStatus projectMeta"><strong>status: </strong>archived</h3>

				<p class="projectDescription">The final project for CIS 1052: Introduction to Web Programming. A Fake Department Store's e-commerce site hand-coded in its entirety. A PHP back-end worked with a MySQL database to serve product information and keep a log of customer information and purchase history. The site also came complete with all the eye candy that my JavaScript could offer, all based off of the script.aculo.us libraries. At the time it was my largest and most complex project yet. I couldn't believe it worked. It will always be a nostalgic source of pride. A moment of realization of what code could do and what I could do.</p>

<!-- thanksgiving party -->
				<h2 class="projectTitle">thanksgiving party</h2>

				<img class="projectImage grayscale" src="http://www.zachfedor.com/images/thanksgivingweb.png" alt="thanksgiving party" height="204" width="304">

				<h3 class="projectTech projectMeta"><strong>tech used: </strong>javascript - php</h3>
				<h3 class="projectStatus projectMeta"><strong>status: </strong>archived</h3>

				<p class="projectDescription">My first steps with cookies, JavaScript animation, and PHP interacting with a database. A middle to end of the semester project for Intro to Web Programming, I built off my already solid knowledge of HTML and CSS to complete this assignment. We were to create an invitation page for 5 friends to RSVP to a thanksgiving party. After they registered, they were faced with a basic JavaScript game to win a discount code. An odd assignment for sure, but it taught the material like it needed to. And I had fun with it.</p>

<!-- mortgage calculator -->
				<h2 class="projectTitle">mortgage calculator</h2>

				<img class="projectImage grayscale" src="http://www.zachfedor.com/images/mortgagecalculatorscreenshotweb.png" alt="mortgage calculator" height="204" width="304">

				<h3 class="projectDate projectMeta"><strong>date: </strong>fall 2010</h3>
				<h3 class="projectTech projectMeta"><strong>tech used: </strong>javascript</h3>
				<h3 class="projectStatus projectMeta"><strong>status: </strong>archived</h3>

				<p class="projectDescription">Adding some math into the equation, this was my first attempt at "real" programming. Instead of just scripting, my code was now interacting and thinking. Kind of. The goal was to write a program to calculate a mortgage based off of a user's input using nothing but JavaScript and a roommate's math textbook. Maybe I'll use this when I grow up someday...</p>

				<h3 class="projectStatus projectMeta"><strong>status: </strong>unmaintained</h3>

				<p class="projectDescription">This is where it all began. During my year off of school in between Drexel and Temple, I needed something to keep my mind active. I decided to build myself a Wordpress blog to learn how to code. It was a big undertaking, and I had no idea how far the rabbit hole went, but I dove in. I would wake up hours before my shift at the coffee shop and pour over the Wordpress codex. I mixed and mashed a Frankenstein monster out of my favorite bits from tutorial sites. I went through introductory lessons of HTML and CSS. I learned about domains and hosting, about coding by hand versus WYSIWYG editors, about valid code and semantics. I also learned a million ways to break a website. But I finished it. I proudly started blogging about all the tips and tricks about the outdoors that I knew. Then I ran out of article ideas. So I came up with more websites to build. That was the fun part anyways.</p>

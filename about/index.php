                <p>My name is Zach Fedor and I strive to be a Renaissance man. I'm most often absorbed in designing and developing websites, reading and writing stories, rock climbing, or philosophy. If you want to see some of the things I've been working on, just head over to the <a href="/projects">projects page</a>.</p>

                <p>Feel free to <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>. I'm always open for a lively discussion, be it for business or pleasure.

                <h2 class="sectionTitle">Employment</h2>

                <p>Currently, I am the Marketing Director at Camp Hebron, a camp and conference center located in Halifax, PA. I plan, manage, and execute all marketing efforts of the organization. I'm also a part of the strategic planning process as a member of the Executive Leadership Team. Other responsibilities include website and social media maintenance, brand management, staff supervision, and IT management.</p>

                <p>Since starting, I've been privileged to take part in a rebranding project, designing a new fleet of brochures, the implementation of a new database system, upgrading our network infrastructure, and a major website overhaul. Occasionally, they let me out of the office to guide a rock climbing trip or some team building initiatives.</p>

                <p>Before Hebron, I've been a freelance web developer, rock climbing instructor, recreation director, barista, camp counselor, lifeguard, and copier/fax technician.</p>

                <h2 class="sectionTitle">Education</h2>

                <p>I graduated from Temple University with a Bachelors Degree in English with a Concentration in Creative Writing and a Minor in Digital Media Technologies. Before that, I also attended Drexel University as a Chemical Engineering major. But as Mark Twain said, I never let my education interfere with my learning. In between schools, I taught myself how to build websites by hand and have continued my extra-curricular curriculum ever since. Right now, I'm trying to learn vim and I'm working my way through the massive CompTIA A+ exam guide. Next, I think I'll learn Python.</p>

                <h2 class="sectionTitle">Hobbies</h2>

                <p>My first love is rock climbing, even though my wife gets jealous. I enjoy anything outdoors. Ultimate Frisbee, slacklining, camping, hiking, and fishing are a few big ones. I love a good story and it doesn't matter to me whether its a good book, a quality show, or just told over a campfire. I'm up for trying just about anything, though. Variety is the spice of life.</p>

                <p>Wisdom beyond age or circumstance can be gleaned from the experiences of those that have walked this earth at a different time or place than my own. The quotes within these pages are not meant to be a replacement of my own thoughts or ideas, they are just a few examples of that shared wisdom which I have taken particularly to heart.

                <h2 class="sectionTitle">Employment</h2>

                <p>Currently, I am a Web Developer at Tower Marketing, a digital marketing agency located in Lancaster, PA. I design, plan, and build custom sites for local small and medium businesses using modern development tools and practices. Most of our sites our built in PHP on top of Wordpress, but some use Drupal or Magento. I collaborate with a team of Project Managers, Designers, SEM Specialists, and other Developers on complete builds, new features, and other maintenance tasks. I also train clients on the use of their new site.</p>

                <p>I was hired as one of three developers, and I was able to learn a lot from them. Now, I am the most senior developer and I am able to fine-tune our process. We had been using git, but I established the Git-Flow system with feature branches instead of the waterfall system used before. I also added the use of package managers to remove unnecessary code from the git repo while also adding a layer of modularity, future maintainability, and portability. Now we rely on Composer for PHP, Bower for site dependencies like jQuery and Bootstrap, and NPM through Node.js for build dependencies like Gulp and Sass. Adding some Bash scripting to the mix and Tower now has an automated  and configurable setup, build, and deploy process.</p>

                <p>Before Tower, I had the opportunity to work at a non-profit as a man of many hats. I was officially their Marketing Director, but I doubled as the IT Manager, Webmaster, and a member of the Executive Leadership Team. I led a rebranding project, designed a new fleet of brochures, implementated a new database system, upgraded the network infrastructure, and completed a major website overhaul. Occasionally, they would let me out of the office to guide a rock climbing trip or some team building initiatives. I have also held the titles of freelance web developer, rock climbing instructor, recreation director, barista, camp counselor, lifeguard, and copier/fax technician.</p>

                <h2 class="sectionTitle">Education</h2>

                <p>I graduated from Temple University with a Bachelors Degree in English with a Concentration in Creative Writing and a Minor in Digital Media Technologies. Before that, I also attended Drexel University as a Chemical Engineering major. But as Mark Twain said, I never let my education interfere with my learning. In between schools, I taught myself how to build websites by hand and have continued my extra-curricular curriculum ever since. Right now, I'm trying to learn vim and I'm working my way through the massive CompTIA A+ exam guide. Next, I think I'll learn Python.</p>

                <h2 class="sectionTitle">Personal</h2>

                <p>I'm 25 years old, happily married, and I love a good challenge. That's probably why I call myself a Rock Climber before anything else. I enjoy anything outdoors: Ultimate Frisbee, slacklining, camping, backpacking, and fishing are a few big ones. I love a good story whether its a good book, a television show, or a tale told told over a campfire. I'm curious, observant, a bit of a joker, and I love to wax philosphical.</p>

                <p>Wisdom beyond age or circumstance can be gleaned from the experiences of those who have walked the earth at a different time or place than my own. As such, do not consider the quotes found within this site to be a replacement for my own original thoughts, but an augmentation of them. The selection found on the <a href="/">home page</a> is a small sample of the noteworthy.</p>
